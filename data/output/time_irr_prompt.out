{"i": 8, "output": "The dates for the specific events mentioned are:\n\n- The Last Night of the Proms in 2003 took place in September, but without a specific date provided in the context, it is traditionally held on the second Saturday in September.\n- The Proms season starts in mid-July and runs for about eight weeks, culminating in the Last Night of the Proms in September.\n\nGiven that the Last Night is usually on a Saturday, and considering the typical length of the season, the 2003 Proms would have likely started in mid-July (around the 18th if we consider a Friday start date) and ended with the Last Night of the Proms on a Saturday in September, which for 2003, would have been September 13th. However, without specific dates for the start of the 2003 season and the Last Night, these are educated guesses based on the usual scheduling of the events."}
